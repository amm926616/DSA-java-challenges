## Easy Challenges

- [ ] Reverse a String  
  *Given a string, return its reverse.*  
  _Hint: Consider using StringBuilder or converting to a character array._

- [ ] Check for Palindrome  
  *Given a string, determine if it's a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). Ignore spaces and case.*  
  _Hint: Two-pointer approach from both ends._

- [ ] Find the Maximum Element in an Array  
  *Given an array of integers, find the largest element.*  
  _Hint: Simple iteration._

- [ ] Implement a Stack using an Array  
  *Create a Stack class with push, pop, peek, and isEmpty methods, backed by a fixed-size array. Handle overflow/underflow.*

- [ ] Implement a Queue using an Array  
  *Create a Queue class with enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty methods, backed by a fixed-size array. Consider circular arrays for efficiency.*

- [ ] Linear Search  
  *Given an array and a target value, find the index of the target using linear search.*

- [ ] Binary Search  
  *Given a sorted array and a target value, find the index of the target using binary search.*  
  _Important: Understand the preconditions for binary search._

- [ ] Count Occurrences of a Character  
  *Given a string and a character, count how many times that character appears in the string.*
